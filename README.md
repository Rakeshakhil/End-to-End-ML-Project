Insurance Premium Prediction Model
This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts insurance premiums based on various factors such as age, gender, smoking status, and medical history. The model is built using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas.

Model
The model is trained using a regression algorithm and has an accuracy of over 80%. It is capable of predicting insurance premiums for new customers based on their demographic and health-related data.

Usage
The model can be used by insurance companies to predict premiums for new customers, allowing them to make data-driven decisions and optimize pricing strategies. The trained model can be integrated into insurance company systems to automate the premium prediction process.
